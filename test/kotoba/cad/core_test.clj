(ns kotoba.cad.core-test
  "Tests for the pure kotoba CAD domain engine (artifact classification,
  coverage/maturity scoring, dry-run runner-plan policy gates).

  FIXED 2026-07-07: `score` and `coverage-assessment` used to call
  `Math/round` directly on values produced by plain Clojure integer
  division (`/`), which on the JVM yields an exact `clojure.lang.Ratio` or
  `Long` rather than a `double` for the entire realistic 'within quota'
  input range -- `Math/round` has no overload for those, so the call threw
  `IllegalArgumentException` (\"No matching method round found taking 1
  args\") for almost every input. Fixed by wrapping the final expression in
  `double` before rounding. This was JVM-only: ClojureScript's numeric tower
  has no separate Ratio/Long types, so the browser build (app.cljs via
  shadow-cljs) was never affected. The tests below assert the correct,
  now-working numeric results (hand-computed) rather than the prior
  crash-on-every-input behavior."
